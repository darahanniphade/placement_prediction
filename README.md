# Logistic Regression Project

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **classification model using Logistic Regression**. Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm commonly used for binary and multiclass classification tasks. The model learns the relationship between input features and the target label, providing probabilities for class membership.

The primary goal of this project was to:
- Understand the behavior and implementation of Logistic Regression.
- Explore how logistic regression performs on real-world data.
- Evaluate the model using suitable performance metrics.

##  Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of multiple input features and a categorical target variable.  
Key characteristics include:
- **Features**: Numerical and/or categorical predictors that influence the output.
- **Target variable**: A binary (0/1) or multiclass label depending on the use case.

The dataset was preprocessed to:
- Handle missing values.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Standardize/normalize numerical features.
- Split into **training** and **testing** sets for evaluation.

##  Methodology
1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns.
   - Cleaned and transformed the dataset to prepare it for modeling.

2. **Model Building**
   - Implemented **Logistic Regression** as the core algorithm.
   - Trained the model on the processed dataset.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Used performance metrics such as:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
     - Confusion Matrix
     - ROC-AUC Curve (for binary classification)

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Logistic Regression successfully classified the data with satisfactory performance.
- The model demonstrated strengths in:
  - Simplicity and interpretability.
  - Fast training and prediction times.
- Limitations included:
  - Sensitivity to multicollinearity among features.
  - Reduced performance when decision boundaries are highly non-linear.

##  Key Learnings
- Logistic Regression is a strong baseline model for classification problems.
- Feature engineering and preprocessing play a crucial role in improving model accuracy.
- Regularization (L1/L2) helps prevent overfitting.

---

##  Future Improvements
- Experiment with feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, correlation analysis).
- Compare Logistic Regression with advanced models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search.
- Apply the model on larger, real-world datasets for practical validation.
